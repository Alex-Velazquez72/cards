                        <h2>Hiriluk</h2>
                        <p> Dr. Hiriluk was a healer and the adoptive father of Chopper. He rescued Chopper and took him
                            to live with him. He was always chasing a dream that took him many years alone, until
                            Chopper came. Thousands of explosions happened in his home, destroying it, but everything
                            was for the sake of completing his research. His last words before he died were:
                            <strong>“When do you think a person dies? When a bullet hits their heart? No. When they have
                                an incurable disease? No. When they eat soup with poisonous mushrooms? NO! A person dies
                                when they are forgotten...”</strong>

                                go far, very, very far, let nothing tie you down... not the iron borders of 'White
